/**
 * Artifacts Architecture Summary
 * 
 * This module provides a complete, modular architecture for artifacts:
 * 
 * üß± **Foundational Layer** (BaseArtifact.ts)
 * - Core artifact interface and metadata
 * - Type definitions and validation utilities
 * - Reference parsing and creation
 * 
 * üèóÔ∏è **Strategic Layer** (StrategicArtifacts.ts)
 * - Vision, Policy, Concept artifacts
 * - Strategic planning and governance
 * - Business rules and principles
 * 
 * ‚ö° **Operational Layer** (OperationalArtifacts.ts)
 * - Process, Procedure, Event artifacts
 * - Workflow and execution logic
 * - Event-driven architecture
 * 
 * üè¢ **Organizational Layer** (OrganizationalArtifacts.ts)
 * - Actor, Area artifacts
 * - Roles and responsibilities
 * - Organizational structure
 * 
 * üîß **Supporting Systems**
 * - Validation: Semantic and structural validation
 * - Interpretation: Artifact processing and analysis
 * - Repository: Storage and retrieval
 * - Plugins: Extensibility system
 * - Engine: Execution orchestration
 * - Events: Event-driven communication
 * - Decisions: Semantic decision framework
 * 
 * **Key Principles:**
 * - Composition over inheritance
 * - Semantic coherence
 * - Traceability to vision
 * - Modular extensibility
 * - Type safety throughout
