# Artifacts Module Integration - Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Hexy Dashboard currently has a partially implemented artifacts module alongside existing artifact management components. This feature aims to ensure complete functionality and seamless integration between the modular artifact system and the current dashboard implementation, following Hexy Framework semantic principles.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Module Architecture Consolidation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a unified artifact management system that follows DDD principles and eliminates code duplication, so that the codebase is maintainable and follows semantic architecture patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing the current codebase THEN the system SHALL identify overlapping functionality between `/src/modules/artifact-module/` and existing components
2. WHEN consolidating architecture THEN the system SHALL preserve all existing functionality while eliminating duplication
3. IF conflicts exist between implementations THEN the system SHALL prioritize the module-based approach following DDD patterns
4. WHEN integration is complete THEN the system SHALL have a single source of truth for artifact management
5. WHEN refactoring THEN the system SHALL maintain backward compatibility with existing component interfaces

### Requirement 2: Service Layer Integration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the artifact services to be properly integrated with the existing Zustand store and event system, so that data flows consistently throughout the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN integrating services THEN the system SHALL connect `ArtifactService` with the existing `artifactStore.ts`
2. WHEN service operations execute THEN the system SHALL emit appropriate events through the `EventBusContext`
3. IF validation occurs THEN the system SHALL use the `ValidationService` for all artifact operations
4. WHEN temporal artifacts are managed THEN the system SHALL use the service layer for state transitions
5. WHEN persistence is required THEN the system SHALL use the `LocalStorageArtifactRepository` implementation

### Requirement 3: Component Integration and Migration

**User Story:** As a user, I want all artifact management features to work seamlessly together, so that I can create, edit, and visualize artifacts without encountering inconsistencies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using the graph interface THEN the system SHALL integrate with the module's `ArtifactGraph.tsx` component
2. WHEN editing artifacts THEN the system SHALL use the module's `ArtifactEditor.tsx` with enhanced validation
3. IF artifact lists are displayed THEN the system SHALL use the module's `ArtifactList.tsx` with advanced filtering
4. WHEN dashboard loads THEN the system SHALL use the module's `ArtifactDashboard.tsx` as the main interface
5. WHEN components communicate THEN the system SHALL use the module's hook system (`useArtifacts.ts`)

### Requirement 4: Type System Unification

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consistent TypeScript types across all artifact-related code, so that type safety is maintained and development is efficient.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN types are defined THEN the system SHALL use the module's comprehensive type definitions from `artifact.types.ts`
2. WHEN existing types conflict THEN the system SHALL migrate to the module's semantic artifact types
3. IF temporal artifacts are used THEN the system SHALL use the module's `TemporalArtifact` interface
4. WHEN relationships are managed THEN the system SHALL use the module's `Relationship` interface
5. WHEN validation occurs THEN the system SHALL use the module's Zod schemas

### Requirement 5: Semantic Validation Enhancement

**User Story:** As a user, I want artifact validation to follow Hexy semantic principles, so that all artifacts maintain organizational coherence and business rule compliance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN artifacts are created THEN the system SHALL validate using semantic business rules
2. WHEN validation fails THEN the system SHALL provide meaningful error messages based on Hexy principles
3. IF artifacts have relationships THEN the system SHALL validate semantic coherence between connected artifacts
4. WHEN artifact types are used THEN the system SHALL enforce type-specific validation rules
5. WHEN purpose, context, authority, and evaluation are defined THEN the system SHALL validate their semantic alignment

### Requirement 6: Graph Visualization Enhancement

**User Story:** As a user, I want an enhanced graph visualization that supports all artifact types and relationships, so that I can understand the organizational knowledge network.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN graph renders THEN the system SHALL display all artifact types with appropriate colors and icons
2. WHEN relationships exist THEN the system SHALL visualize semantic connections between artifacts
3. IF artifacts are created via graph THEN the system SHALL use the integrated temporal artifact system
4. WHEN graph interactions occur THEN the system SHALL maintain consistency with the service layer
5. WHEN performance is measured THEN the system SHALL handle up to 1000 artifacts and 5000 relationships efficiently

### Requirement 7: Testing and Quality Assurance

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive tests for the integrated system, so that reliability and maintainability are ensured.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN integration is complete THEN the system SHALL have unit tests for all service integrations
2. WHEN components are integrated THEN the system SHALL have integration tests for component interactions
3. IF existing tests exist THEN the system SHALL migrate and enhance them for the new architecture
4. WHEN test coverage is measured THEN the system SHALL maintain >80% coverage for artifact-related code
5. WHEN performance tests run THEN the system SHALL meet the defined performance targets

### Requirement 8: Documentation and Migration Guide

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear documentation of the integration process and new architecture, so that future development and maintenance are efficient.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN integration is complete THEN the system SHALL provide updated API documentation
2. WHEN architecture changes THEN the system SHALL document architectural decisions and patterns
3. IF migration occurs THEN the system SHALL provide a migration guide for existing code
4. WHEN new features are added THEN the system SHALL update usage documentation
5. WHEN troubleshooting is needed THEN the system SHALL provide debugging and troubleshooting guides
